	// UUID is the UUID of the player. It is the same UUID that the client sent in the Login packet at the
	// start of the session. A player with this UUID must exist in the player list (built up using the
	// PlayerList packet), for it to show up in-game.
	UUID uuid.UUID
	// Username is the name of the player. This username is the username that will be set as the initial
	// name tag of the player.
	Username string
	// EntityRuntimeID is the runtime ID of the player. The runtime ID is unique for each world session, and
	// entities are generally identified in packets using this runtime ID.

	// Nintendo Switch). It is otherwise an empty string, and is used to decide which players are able to
	// chat with each other.

	// Position is the position to spawn the player on. If the player is on a distance that the viewer cannot
	// see it, the player will still show up if the viewer moves closer.

	// HeadYaw is the same as Yaw, except that it applies specifically to the head of the player. A different

	// EntityProperties is a list of properties that the entity inhibits. These properties define and alter specific
	// attributes of the entity.

	// AbilityData represents various data about the abilities of a player, such as ability layers or permissions.
	AbilityData protocol.AbilityData
	// EntityLinks is a list of entity links that are currently active on the player. These links alter the
	// way the player shows up when first spawned in terms of it shown as riding an entity. Setting these
	// links is important for new viewers to see the player is riding another entity.
