// AdventureSettings is sent by the server to update game-play related features, in particular permissions to
// access these features for the client. It includes allowing the player to fly, build and mine, and attack
// entities. Most of these flags should be checked server-side instead of using this packet only.
// The client may also send this packet to the server when it updates one of these settings through the
// in-game settings interface. The server should verify if the player actually has permission to update those
// settings.
