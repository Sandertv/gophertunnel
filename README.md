## Overview
gophertunnel is composed of several packages that may be of use for creating Minecraft related tools. A brief
overview of all packages may be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/github.com/sandertv/gophertunnel?tab=packages).

## Examples
Examples on how to dial a connection or start a server can be found in the [minecraft package](https://github.com/Sandertv/gophertunnel/tree/master/minecraft).
Additionally, a MITM proxy is implemented in the [main.go file](https://github.com/Sandertv/gophertunnel/blob/master/main.go).
